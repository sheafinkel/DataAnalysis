# DataAnalysis

### Introduction

The goal of this project was to analyze population estimates, unemployment rates, and population changes by county as well as their relationship to each other to see if they are correlated. The conclusion is that population changes seem to be independent of unemployment rates, however highly unemployed counties always have small populations.
